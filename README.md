# My First Delve Into Android Development
This is a little object oriented contacts-list app that I built during the Udemy course called "Android Development From Scratch Like a Pro." Things I learned include:

- The Activity Life Cycle
- How to build layouts in XML
- View bindings
- Navigating between activities with Intents & Extras
- Working with forms
- Working with SQLite using the DAO model
- Clean build vs. hot-swap
- OnClickListeners
- Toast
